    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A little bit of homemade basil pesto and balsamic glaze on top would be sooo good! I like to serve these baked tomatoes as a side with grilled chicken breasts, baked pesto salmon, creamy garlic scallops, or pan seared ribeyes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
       <li>1 large tomato, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices</li>
       <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves stripped and finely chopped</li>
       <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
       <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush a baking sheet with about 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Arrange tomato slices on the baking sheet; sprinkle rosemary and garlic on top. Brush with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
